## How to Test the Application üß™

### 1. Start the Server

Make sure you have Go installed. Then, run the server from the project directory.

---

### 2. Testing GET Endpoints in the Browser

Server provides two GET endpoints that can be tested directly from the browser by entering the URL. Both endpoints accept query parameters, so you can easily customize the request.

#### `/hello` endpoint (GET):
**Returns a personalized JSON greeting message. Optionally takes a name parameter via the query string.**   
*Try changing the name for a different greeting. The server never gets tired of saying hello!*
- Open your browser.
- In the address bar, enter (replace ```Hanka``` with any name you like):

  ```
  http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Hanka
  ```

- **Response:** You‚Äôll see a JSON message like:
  ```json
  {
  "message": "Hello Hanka!"
  }
  ```
  
#### `/data` endpoint (GET):
**Returns a JSON message and echoes back the provided id and type parameters.**   
*Send your data and see it come right back at you! It‚Äôs like playing catch with a server.*
- Open your browser.
- In the address bar, enter (replace ```123456``` and ```user``` with any name you like):

  ```
  http://localhost:8080/data?id=123456&type=user
  ```

- **Response:** You‚Äôll see a JSON message like:
  ```json
  {
     "message": "Data retrieved.",
     "data": {
       "id": "123456",
       "type": "user"
     }
  }
  ```

### 2. Testing POST Endpoints in the Browser
#### `/submit` endpoint (POST):
**Accepts a JSON object with name, surname, and email in the request body. Returns a confirmation message and saves the data.**   
*Submit your name, surname, and email. The server will remember‚Ä¶ at least until you delete the file!*
**With Postman:**

1. Open Postman.
2. Set the method to POST.
3. Enter the URL:
```http://localhost:8080/submit```
4. Go to the Body tab, select raw, and choose JSON.
5. Enter sample data:
```json
{
    "name": "Martin",
    "surname": "West",
    "email": "martin.west@example.com"
}
```
6. Click **Send**.
7. You should see a JSON response like:
```json
{
    "message": "Data received for user Martin West (martin.west@example.com).",
    "data": {
        "name": "Martin",
        "surname": "West",
        "email": "martin.west@example.com"
    }
}
```

**With curl:**
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Alice", "surname": "Blue", "email": "alice.blue@example.com"}' http://localhost:8080/submit
```
